# langchain-practice

## Getting started

- If you are using _**Open**_, head over to Open AI and get an API key.
  - Once you have an API key save this in a file in the current location as `openai_key.txt` (This can be stored else and the path can be updated in the notebook you are using)
  - Make a copy of the LangChain OpenAI Template notbook and get started building.
  - _**Note**_ key.txt will be ignored from git
  - OpenAI may require payment if you hit limits on your free accout usage.
