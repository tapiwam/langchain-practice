In the summer of that year the tide turned in favor of the allies. But this Government did not relax. In fact, our national effort was stepped up. In August, 1918, the draft age limits were broadened from 21-31 to 18-45. The President called for \"force to the utmost,\" and his call was heeded.

We cannot be content, no matter how high that general standard of living may be, if some fraction of our peopleâ€”whether it be one-third or one-fifth or one-tenth- is ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill housed, and insecure.\\n\\nThis Republic had its beginning, and grew to its present strength, under the protection of certain inalienable political rightsâ€”among them the right of free speech, free press, free worship, trial by jury, freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures. They were our rights to life and liberty.\\n\\nAs our Nation has grown in size and stature, howeverâ€”as our industrial economy expandedâ€”these political rights proved inadequate to assure us equality in the pursuit of happiness.\\n\\nWe have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence. \"Necessitous men are not free men.\" People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made.\\n\\nIn our day these economic truths have become accepted as self-evident. We have accepted, so to speak, a second Bill of Rights under which a new basis of security and prosperity can be established for all regardless of station, race, or creed.\\n\\nAmong these are:\\n\\nThe right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the Nation;\\n\\nThe right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation;\\n\\nThe right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living;\\n\\nThe right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad;\\n\\nThe right of every family to a decent home;\\n\\nThe right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health;\\n\\nThe right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment;\\n\\nThe right to a good education.', metadata={'source': 'langchain/extras/01-Data-Connections/some_data/FDR_State_of_Union_1944.txt'}),\n",

For unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world.\\n\\nOne of the great American industrialists of our dayâ€”a man who has rendered yeoman service to his country in this crisis-recently emphasized the grave dangers of \"rightist reaction\" in this Nation. All clear-thinking businessmen share his concern. Indeed, if such reaction should developâ€”if history were to repeat itself and we were to return to the so-called \"normalcy\" of the 1920\\'sâ€”then it is certain that even though we shall have conquered our enemies on the battlefields abroad, we shall have yielded to the spirit of Fascism here at home.\\n\\nI ask the Congress to explore the means for implementing this economic bill of rights- for it is definitely the responsibility of the Congress so to do. Many of these problems are already before committees of the Congress in the form of proposed legislation.
